### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:v: My name is Arthur and I am learning Python.  
:book: I've been studying Backend development since June 2020.

I don't have many projects yet, but the biggest ones are:
- **[anygram](https://github.com/ouriso/anygram-project)** - it's a social network where photographers can upload their photos and talk about the technologies and props used to create. Stack: `Django`, `Django REST Framework`, `git actions`, `Docker-compose`
- **[live_poster](https://github.com/ouriso/live_poster)** - it's a simple social network where you can write posts, leave comments, subscribe to other persons. Stack: `Django`, `unittest`  
- **[yamdb_final](https://github.com/ouriso/api_yamdb)** - it's a simple API with functions similar to IMDb. You can rate films, books, etc. and leave comments on other people's ratings. Stack: `Django REST Framework`, `git actions`, `Docker-compose`  
- **[api_auth](https://github.com/ouriso/api_auth_test)** - it's a simple API for users registration and administration. Stack: `Django REST Framework`, `unittest`  

âš¡ Fun fact: The traslation of 'ouriÃ§o' from Portuguese means 'hedgehog`. This is my nickname in capoeira.
