### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:v: My name is Arthur and I am learning Python.  
:book: I've been studying Backend development since June 2020.

I don't have many projects yet, but the biggest ones are:
- **hw05_final** - it's a simple social network where you can write posts, leave comments, subscribe to other persons. Stack: `Django`, `unittest`  
- **api-yamdb** - it's a simple API with functions similar to IMDb. You can rate films, books, etc. and leave comments on other people's ratings. Stack: `Django REST Framework`  
- **test-assignment** - it's a simple API for users registration and administration. Stack: `Django REST Framework`, `unittest`  

âš¡ Fun fact: The traslation of 'ouriÃ§o' from Portuguese means 'hedgehog`. This is my nickname in capoeira.
